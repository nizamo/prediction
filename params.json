These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).\r\n\r\n#Data\r\nThe training data for this project are available here:\r\nhttps://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv\r\nThe test data are available here:\r\nhttps://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv\r\nThe data for this project is come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

The 5 possible methods include -\r\nA: exactly according to the specification\r\nB: throwing the elbows to the front\r\nC: lifting the dumbbell only halfway\r\nD: lowering the dumbbell only halfway\r\nE: throwing the hips to the front\r\n\r\n##############################################################################\r\n# Data Preparation\r\nDownloaded the data and save it in your working directory.
